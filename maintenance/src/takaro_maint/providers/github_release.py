"""GitHub releases, as a provider any game can point at without new Python.

Several of the remaining connectors are built against a framework that ships as a GitHub
release — Carbon for Rust, BepInEx builds, loader jars — and each of them would otherwise
arrive with its own little fetcher. This provider is the shared one: a game declares a
source and a watch block in its catalog record, and gets acquisition (``fetch_input``),
addressing (``input_url``) and discovery (``observe``) from here.

The one thing it refuses to assume is that a tag is a version. Carbon's tags
(``production_build``, ``edge_build``) are *rolling*: the same tag is re-uploaded in place
whenever a build is cut, so a scan that keyed on the tag would file one issue in the
project's lifetime and then go quiet forever. A channel that says ``mutable: true`` folds
the asset's published digest into the revision, which makes every re-upload a new
revision — and says so by reporting ``heads-only`` history, because the uploads between
two scans were never seen and are not claimed.
