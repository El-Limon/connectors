"""The Rust adapter: a Steam-delivered server, a modding framework, and a source plugin.

Three things make this game its own shape. The server arrives as two Steam depots, so the
adapter owns its ``install`` the way 7D2D does. On top of it sits Carbon, a framework that
is *not* part of the depot: it is a GitHub release asset, unpacked into the same tree and
pinned by its own hash, so the install has a second half and the ledger has four extra
witnesses. And the artifact is a ``.cs`` file that Carbon compiles when it loads it, so the
release is source, the compile-check in CI is the authoritative build for the fingerprint,
and deploying means putting the file where the framework looks for it.

There is no image to build. The runtime container is a digest-pinned base image; what turns
it into a Rust server is the installed tree and the tracked ``games/rust/start.sh``, mounted
in and named as the container's command.
