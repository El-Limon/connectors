"""Project Zomboid's verification hooks: what the generic runner cannot know about it.

The server writes no Mojang-shaped line about itself, so every base check that reads one
is replaced here. ``connector-load`` reads a Fabric-shaped loader version and becomes
``agent-load``; the Minecraft catalogue spot-checks become ``catalog``; the base
``console`` sends ``say``, which is not a Project Zomboid console command, and becomes
``rcon``; and ``shutdown`` waits for the container to exit, which this image's entrypoint
never does on its own, so it becomes ``stop`` (the 7 Days to Die precedent).

Two checks exist only for this game. ``pinned-install`` is the proof that the SteamCMD
stub an install writes really did stop the image replacing the pinned bytes, and
``hooks-bound`` is the proof that the ByteBuddy hooks pinned to 42.20.4 signatures still
bind. What ``hooks-bound`` cannot prove is that the player-lifecycle hooks FIRE: that
needs a connected game client, which no unattended run has. The check says so in its own
detail rather than letting a reader assume otherwise.

``--takaro hosted`` is out of scope for this game: there is no ``run_hosted`` here, so a
hosted run is refused by the runner rather than half-performed.
