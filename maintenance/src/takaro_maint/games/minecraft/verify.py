"""Minecraft's verification hooks: what the generic runner cannot know about this game.

The runner discovers this module by name and calls into it at three points of a local run
(after the protocol checks, after shutdown, and for the opt-in negative check) or hands the
whole run over for ``--takaro hosted``. Everything generic lives in ``verify.checks_lifecycle``;
what is here is Minecraft: which banners name a runtime, which target is a sibling of which,
what a hosted gameserver is called, and what a refusal looks like on these loaders.
