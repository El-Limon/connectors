"""``scan`` — turn what upstream published into deduplicated maintenance issues.

One pass: read every watched source, work out which revisions have never been seen, and
reconcile each one into exactly one GitHub issue. Read-only is the default and writes
nothing at all; ``--publish`` is the only way to change the tracker. No state is kept on
disk — the checkpoints and the work identities live in the dashboard issue (the shared
download cache is the only thing a run leaves behind), so a fresh runner with an empty
home directory resumes exactly where the last run stopped.
