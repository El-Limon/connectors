/**
 * Joins the native plugin's player refs to Takaro's `gameId` (the FLS id).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A JOIN IS NEEDED AT ALL
 *
 * The map server process holds no FLS id. Lane L1b checked every UPROPERTY on `DunePlayerState`,
 * `DunePlayerStateBase` and `DunePlayerConnectionInfo` and found no account identifier; the FLS id is
 * a string the game only ever needs out of process (chat routing keys and the GM command envelope).
 *
 * What lane L2 found on the live class layouts IS the Postgres identity, on
 * `DunePlayerControllerPersistenceComponent`:
 *
 *   m_AccountID                → encrypted_player_state.account_id   (bigint → encrypted_accounts.id)
 *   m_PlayerStateUniqueID      → encrypted_player_state.player_state_id       (bigint → actors.id)
 *   m_PlayerControllerUniqueID → encrypted_player_state.player_controller_id  (bigint → actors.id)
 *   m_PlayerCharacterUniqueID  → encrypted_player_state.player_pawn_id        (bigint → actors.id)
 *   m_CharacterName            → decrypt(encrypted_character_name)
 *
 * and `accounts` is the view that turns an `encrypted_accounts.id` into the FLS id in the clear. So
 * the primary route is ONE HOP ON A PRIMARY KEY: `plugin accountId === roster row's accountId`, and
 * the roster row already carries `flsId`. No new SQL is needed — `pg.roster()` selects
 * `ps.account_id` and `ps.character_name` already.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ROUTES, IN PRIORITY ORDER, EACH WITH ITS CONFIDENCE
 *
 *  1. `accountId`     — a primary-key equality. **High** confidence; the only uncertainty is whether
 *     the plugin's 8-byte id struct really holds that bigint, which the first join settles by
 *     agreeing (or not) with route 3.
 *  2. `playerPawnId` / `playerStateId` / `playerControllerId` — also exact, but the roster does not
 *     select them, so they are used only as a CORROBORATION when a caller supplies them
 *     (`disagreements()` counts the cases where two routes pick different players).
 *  3. `characterName` — case-insensitive equality on `player_state.character_name`. **Medium**: names
 *     are not unique by schema (there is no UNIQUE constraint on the decrypted name), so a name that
 *     matches more than one roster row is REFUSED rather than guessed.
 *
 * A ref that no route resolves yields `null`, and every caller then degrades — it never picks the
 * only online player "because there is only one". That shortcut is exactly how a kill gets credited
 * to the wrong person on a two-player server.
