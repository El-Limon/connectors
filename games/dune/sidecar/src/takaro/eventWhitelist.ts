/**
 * Takaro's gameEvent DTOs are STRICTLY whitelisted and an extra field kills the whole event.
 *
 * Measured on the live rig 2026-09-21: a perfectly good `entity-killed` (plugin seq 3, "Scavenger Thug", killed by
 * TakaroTest) was thrown away with
 *
 *   An instance of EventEntityKilled has failed the validation:
 *    - property entityCode has failed the following constraints: whitelistValidation
 *
 * because the sidecar attached its own debugging fields (`entityCode`, `nameIsClassName`, `weaponCode`,
 * `attribution`). The cause is in Takaro's own source: inbound game events are validated with
 * `{ forbidNonWhitelisted: true, forbidUnknownValues: true }` (`app-connector/src/lib/GameServerManager.ts`), unlike
 * the response DTOs (`listItems` and friends), which merely drop unknown keys.
 *
 * So this module is the single chokepoint every outgoing gameEvent passes through. Sources may carry as much context
 * as they like internally — it is useful in the debug log and in the plugin's own `/events` record — but exactly these
 * keys reach the wire. When a future Takaro version adds a field, it is added here once; when one of ours leaks, the
 * unit test fails instead of a player's kill disappearing in silence.
 *
 * Field lists transcribed from `packages/lib-modules/src/dto/gameEvents.ts` + `dto/base.ts`.
